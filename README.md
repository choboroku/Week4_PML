# Week4_PML

This repo contains the files to complete the assignment for week 4 of the 
Practical Machine Learning course.

It contains the following files:

pml_project.Rmd
pml_project.html
pml_project.RData

For pml_project.Rmd, use RStudio and compile the code using knitr. 
You can execute the codes in R console if you wish. It can take some
time depending on the machine you are using. FYI, the R image pml_project.RData 
was included to make easier in the final part of the report.
